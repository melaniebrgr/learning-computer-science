# Debug Diaries

> Your success in life will be determined largely by your ability to speak, your ability to write, and the quality of your ideas. In that order. - Patrick Winston, ["How to speak"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY)

The debug diaries follow the reverse. In public, collecting knowledge of shallow profundity, synthesizing them with writting, to maybe one day speaking about them quasi cogently.
