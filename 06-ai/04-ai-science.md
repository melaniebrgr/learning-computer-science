- protein structure prediction: AlphaFold
- de novo protein design: Chai Discovery (antibodies), Cradle

"Cradle operates a platform for generating and optimizing proteins across industries, while Chai develops foundation models primarily for de novo antibody design."

## AlphaFold 1-3

AlphaFold 3 covered "the rest of the PDB", including models containing nucleic acids. AlphaFold was originally developed by DeepMind since its acquisition in 2014, which is Google’s AI research lab and now part of Google DeepMind under Alphabet. The team at DeepMind is led by Demis Hassabis and John Jumper.

> The introduction of AlphaFold 21 has spurred a revolution in modelling the structure of proteins and their interactions, enabling a huge range of applications in protein modelling and design.

> AlphaFold 3 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues. The new AlphaFold model demonstrates substantially improved accuracy over many previous specialized tools: far greater accuracy for protein–ligand interactions compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher accuracy for protein–nucleic acid interactions compared with nucleic-acid-specific predictors and substantially higher antibody–antigen prediction accuracy compared with AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.37,8.

> These results show that high-accuracy modelling across biomolecular space is possible within a single unified deep-learning framework.

> The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to David Baker “for computational protein design” and to Demis Hassabis and John M. Jumper “for protein structure prediction”. Proteins are life’s essential building blocks, nature’s most ingenious molecular machines and the basis of all living organisms. Hassabis and Jumper have developed a series of artificial intelligence models to address the decades-long structural biology problem of how to predict the complex 3D structures of proteins solely from their linear amino acid sequences, while Baker has dedicated his scientific career to designing and constructing proteins that are not, and even can not, be found in nature
