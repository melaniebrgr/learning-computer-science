# AI Tools

## AI SDK

Benefits:

- Call AI SDK and it handles the glue code involved in using different LLMs
- Helpers for common use cases, stream text, structured outputs, tool calling, handle agents
- free OOS, LLM providers

Parts:

- Core: backend for Node
- UI: framework agnostic hooks
- RSC: server components for generative UI

Usages:

- Streaming and "plain" fetching of generated text
- Streaming and "plain" fetching of structured outputs
- Receiving data as structured output so it can be displayed in custom UI
- Sending custom system messages with a common interface
- Tool calling on the client

- [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js): The TensorFlow ecosystem is a suite of tools for training models, a repository of existing models (vision, body, text, audio) and technology for deploying models. It provides full neural network ops and WebGL/WebGPU back-ends.
- [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/): "ml5.js aims to make machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists, creative coders, and students. The library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, building on top of TensorFlow.js"
- [ONNX Runtime Web](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/): ONNX Runtime Web is a JavaScript library that enables running ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) machine learning models directly in web browsers with WebAssembly and WebGL. It supports models trained in frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, converted to ONNX format.
