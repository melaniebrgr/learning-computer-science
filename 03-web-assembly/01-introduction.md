# Web Assembly (WASM)

Wasm is technology for running portable programs in a safe and efficient manner.
It is aimed primarily at the web platform.

WASM a low level-of abstraction suitable as an intermediate representation of a higher-level program — i.e. WebAssembly code is intended to be generated by compilers rather than being written by humans

## History

## Application

It’s natural and expected to create web apps that use both JavaScript and WebAssembly modules. For example, if you want universal JPEG 2000 support, you no longer have to wait for it to be supported in all browsers but can cross-compile a decoder to WebAssembly and call it from JavaScript (1).

Being able to run code in the browser at near native speeds can potentially improve the iteration time of the web platform. Browsers can focus on exposing low-level hardware primitives (WebGL, Bluetooth, USB, etc.) and leave the development of higher-level libraries to the community (1).
