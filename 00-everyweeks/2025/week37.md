# Onsite intreview prep

## 1. Interview with your potential future manager (9:30)

This is your chance to both impress and assess. Think of it as a two-way conversation rather than a strict evaluation. Preparation tips:

What they’ll likely look for

- Motivation & fit
Why this company, why now, and why biotech? They’ll want to sense your enthusiasm and alignment with their mission.
- Collaboration style
How you work with managers and teammates, how you handle feedback, and how you solve conflicts.
- Adaptability
Startups pivot quickly—expect questions about how you’ve handled ambiguity or fast changes.
- Technical/role fit
They may lightly probe your skills, but mostly they’ll want to see if you can grow into the role.

How you can prepare

- Know their mission and tech stack
Review the startup’s site, any publications, and their product roadmap if available.
- Have clear stories ready
Use STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for 2–3 examples that show teamwork, problem-solving, and resilience.
- Prepare thoughtful questions (this is key at this stage):
- How do you see this role evolving in the next year?
- What does success look like in the first 3–6 months?
- How do you like to give feedback and support your team?
- How does the team balance research rigor with startup speed?

## 2. The onsite problem (10:15 onwards)

This is the heart of the day, so aim to show how you think, not just what you know.

What it likely is

Since they call it “onsite problem → whiteboarding → prototyping → presentation,” expect something practical but scoped:

- Designing a small feature, pipeline, or workflow relevant to their product.
- Debugging or architecting a simplified system.
- Showing how you handle incomplete specs, technical trade-offs, and creativity under time constraints.

How to prepare

- Brush up on fundamentals: If you’re in software/engineering, review data structures, APIs, system design basics, and problem-solving patterns. If it’s product/biotech-focused, review workflows, experimental design, or tools common in the stack they use.
- Practice whiteboarding: Be comfortable sketching system diagrams, schemas, or workflows clearly. Narrate your thinking.
- Think aloud: They care more about your reasoning, how you break down complexity, and whether you ask clarifying questions.
- Time management: You’ll need to move from brainstorming → building → presenting. Don’t get stuck polishing. Build a working slice (MVP), then explain what you’d add with more time.
- Presentation skills: At 16:00, you’re essentially “demoing.” Practice framing your work:
- The problem you tackled
- The approach and trade-offs
- What worked, what didn’t, and what you’d do next

## ✅ Summary of prep plan for next 4 days

- Research company + role deeply.
- Prepare 2–3 strong personal stories (teamwork, learning, conflict resolution).
- Draft a list of good questions for your manager.
- Brush up on fundamentals + be ready to whiteboard.
- Do a timed practice “mini project” → spend 3 hours tackling a small coding/problem-solving task, then present it in 10 minutes.
