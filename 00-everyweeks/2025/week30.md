# Week 30: Journalling

"Web pages aren’t that different from what they were in the late ’90s, early 2000s. They’re still just forms. They still just write to databases. A lot of people, I think are very uncomfortable with the fact that they are essentially CRUD monkeys. They just make systems that create, read, update or delete rows in a database, and they have to compensate for that existential dread by over-complicating things." - [DHH](https://lexfridman.com/dhh-david-heinemeier-hansson-transcript)

Or, we can try to do something new. We can build more interesting experiences on the internet than CRUD.

"We’ve been far too willing to hand over far too much of our developer ergonomics to the merchants of complexity" - [DHH](https://lexfridman.com/dhh-david-heinemeier-hansson-transcript)
