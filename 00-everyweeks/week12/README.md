# Guess-the-pinyin (feat Rustlings)

## Week 12 project journaling

The goal for this week is simply to elaborate the guess-the-pinyin app.
For every tutorial, rustling or chapter of the Rust book I read I will find someway of incorporating that new knowledge into the app.
I will also complete the list of backlogged features I imagined for the app.
The app should be still be compilable to wasm at the end of the week, and this time I will deploy it somewhere.

### Stupid questions

- [ ] What does `cdylib` do?
- [ ] What does `wasm-bindgen` do?
- [ ] Why is `extern "C"` used to import functions from browser-land?
- [ ] Can I add a build script to `cargo.toml` like I would `package.json`?
- [ ] How can I debug wasm _well_?
- [ ] How can I deploy a web app?
- [ ] Can I compile to wasm on save?
