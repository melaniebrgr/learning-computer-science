# Guess-the-pinyin (feat Rustlings)

## Week 12 project journaling

The goal for this week is simply to elaborate the guess-the-pinyin app.
For every tutorial, rustling or chapter of the Rust book I read I will find someway of incorporating that new knowledge into the app.
I will also complete the list of backlogged features I imagined for the app.
The app should be still be compilable to wasm at the end of the week, and this time I will deploy it somewhere.
