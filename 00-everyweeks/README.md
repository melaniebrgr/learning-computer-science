# Everyweeks

The idea is stolen from [beeple](https://www.beeple-crap.com/everydays) and [coding garden's try Fridays](https://coding.garden/) except the timescale is a week, not a day. It will go something like this:

- Monday: learn and ideate
- Tuesday: learn and ideate
- Wednesday: build
- Thursday: build
- Friday: build
- Saturday: share
- Sunday: even god rested for a day (but also choose the next topic)

Basically I will try something for a week, document my learning, judge its success then move on to the next thing. There are 52 weeks in a year, I already missed the first few in 2024, so starting today, which is week 8. Status codes will signal how well I think it went:

- 102: processing
- 200: successful
- 206: partially successful
- 400: fail (my fault)
- 501: fail (not my fault)

|   8  | Rust command line game: guess the pinyin | 400 | I needed to learn more language basics first. |

|  11  | [Rust in JavaScript](./week11/) | 200 | Too much wasm and not enough Rust programming. |
