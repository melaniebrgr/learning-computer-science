# Everyweeks

The idea is stolen from [beeple](https://www.beeple-crap.com/everydays) and [coding garden's try Fridays](https://coding.garden/) except the timescale is a week, not a day. It will go something like this:

- Monday: learn and ideate
- Tuesday: learn and ideate
- Wednesday: build
- Thursday: build
- Friday: build
- Saturday: share
- Sunday: rest and choose the next topic

Basically I will try something for a week, document my learning, judge its success then move on to the next thing. There are 52 weeks in a year, I already missed the first few in 2024, so starting today, which is week 8. Status codes will signal how well I think it went:

- 102: processing
- 200: successful
- 206: partially successful
- 303: see other
- 403: not found (failure my fault)
- 503: service unavailable (failure not my fault)
