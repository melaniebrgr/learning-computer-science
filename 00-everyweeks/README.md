# Everyweeks

The idea is stolen from [beeple](https://www.beeple-crap.com/everydays) and [coding garden's try Fridays](https://coding.garden/) except the timescale is a week, not a day. It will go something like this:

- Monday: learn and ideate
- Tuesday: learn and ideate
- Wednesday: build
- Thursday: build
- Friday: build
- Saturday: share
- Sunday: even god rested for a day (but also choose the next topic)

Basically I will try something for a week and then move on to the next thing. There are 52 weeks in a year, I already missed the first few in 2024, so starting today, which is week 8.

| week | topic                                                | status | comments |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- |
|   8  | Rust command line game: guess the pinyin | FAIL | Didn't finish by EOW. I had to learn the language basics first. |
|   9  | [Rust CLI: guess the pinyin](./week09/) | SUCCESS | It runs. I'm taking the W. |
|  10  | Rust in JavaScript | FAIL | Didn't finish by EOW, but learned more about Wasm. |
|  11  | [Rust in JavaScript](./week11/) | SUCCESS | Too much wasm and not enough Rust programming though. |
