# Antibodies

How does the body detect "foreign invaders"? Pathogens like viruses and bacteria are coated with proteins and polysaccharides which are specific to these microorganisms. In the blood are circulating small proteins called **antibodies** (particles that "act against bodies") that are tuned to detect these foreign proteins and polysaccharides or **antigens** (antibody generators because they can generate an immune response).
