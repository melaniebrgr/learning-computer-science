Every product has a "spine", the core promise, that thing which keeps it upright and centered.

> The spine is the statement you make to yourself outlining your intentions for the work. You intend to tell this story. You intend to explore this theme. You intend to employ this structure. The audience may infer it or not, but if you stick to your spine the piece will work. - Twyla Tharp

The core promise has to hold. "[Early] users will forgive a rough experience. They won’t forgive feeling like guinea pigs in an experiment that puts their own customers or their own reputation at risk." Gibe quality 20-30 percent of the team's capacity per cycle.

Have explicit dicsussions of what "ready to launch" means at different stages, instead of crossing your fingers for an arbitrary launch date.

> [W]rite out, in plain language, what “ready for first real users” means for you, and what “ready for everyone” means. Then walk through your current state against those descriptions and ask, “Given where we are, who would we feel good about inviting in, under what conditions?” - Willian

## Stage 0 to 1: Ready for users in a controlled setting

i.e. limited geography, segment, or contract type

- core flows don’t lose or corrupt data
- basic instrumentation
- turn the product off safely with a flag
- simple playbook for the top failure modes

Might include beta branding, having a personal contact/CS person at hand for support.

## Stage 1 to many: Ready for general availability

- strengthening of the previous docs and support tooling
- migration paths from older systems
- performance at the scale actually expected
- sign-off from legal and risk for wide distribution

## Higher risk products?

E.g. health, finance

- prior agreement on lines we don't cross, e.g. a flaw that allows client's to access each other's data

> It’s a habit of making those trade-offs visible and deliberate, week after week
