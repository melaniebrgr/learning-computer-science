# State pattern

State machines are memoryless machines that make decisions based on where they are currently.

## How to represent (finite) state

1. **A graph**: A finite state machine can be visualised by a graph of verteces and directed where each vertex is a finite state and each edge is transition to the next state. An end state is represented as a double circle.
2. **A table**: A table can be used to enumerate all the possible states and how to get to the in one convenient lookup table.
