# Command pattern

Actualise system actions into objects with a common interface ("command packets"), so that they can be attached to different events, passed around, queued, dispatched or whatever else you can imagine. Command packets will be pinging around your system with the following shape:

```js
// stabCommand
{
  execute: (enemy) => { actor.stab(enemy); }
  undo: (enemy) => { enemy.heal(); }
}
```

The advantages of the Command pattern are the utter convenience of attaching and unattaching commands to certain events, undoing and redoing individual commands, and undoing and redoing chains of commands (assuming commands are stored in a queue).
