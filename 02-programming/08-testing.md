# Testing

Test because you're lazy

- **confidence to refactor**: as the code grows or in a codebase that's not yours without tests you might not risk refactoring to fix an issue and implement some hack instead, which makes the overall problem worse.
- **document the code**: better than documentation--it's verifiable. Assertions about what shoul dbe true about the system are codified in a test. It's a form of communication for new developers _and_ you're future self. Tests are example of how things should work that allow you to generalise about how the system works.
- **develope faster**: It is _critical_ that writing and running tests be easier than the application so you can narrowly focus on a problem instead of getting the application into a state to validate the change.
- **improve AI output**
