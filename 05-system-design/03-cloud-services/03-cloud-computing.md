# 03 Cloud services

## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources and capabilities over the internet
There are a number of cloud computing service providers, such as AWS, Azure, and GCP, which own and operate their own IT infrastructure.
Typically we don't rent a whole machine, but a "slice" of a server, e.g. EC2.

With on-premises IT you have complete control and responsibility over the physical hardware and software running on the machine. However you are responsible for capacity planning and upgrading, securing, and handling infrastructre outages. Having too much or too little capacity is a common problem, and typically you do no have the elasticity to handle large events.

By contrast cloud computing providers manage the underlying infrastructure, have datacenters around the globe for redundancy, and to choose the best location for users, and offer service guarantees (SLAs).
Rapid, on-demand elasticity, and scalability are cloud features.

There are three main cloud computing service models:

1. infrastructure as a service (IaaS) e.g. EC2,
2. platform as a service (PaaS), e.g. elastic beanstalk, and
3. software as a service (SaaS) e.g. Salesforce, Dropbox, Gmail, Facebook.

There are three cloud deployment models: private, public and hybrid. In a private cloud you own and operate your own datacenter and have total control over the stack. The biggest reason for doing so is security. A public cloud can offer economies of scale and elasticity. A hybrid cloud, of course, is a combination of both.
