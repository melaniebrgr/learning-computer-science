## AWS migration and Transfer Services

AWS offers tools for migrating on premises databases, servers and file servers to the cloud, e.g. AWS Migration Hub, AWS Database Migration Service, Server Migration Service, and Datasync. You can migrate databases homogeneously (Oracle to Oracle) or heterogeneously (Oracle to Amazon) with Database Migration Service. You can migrate servers with Server Migration Service. Under the hood the server volumes are replicated in EBS and used to save an AMI which is then used to launch an EC2 instance. With Datasync filesystems can be migrated over TLS to S3, FSx (Windows specific), or EFS. AWS Migration Hub, is useful for planning the migration process and viewing their status.
