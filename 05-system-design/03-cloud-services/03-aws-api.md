## AWS API

### AWS API Gateway

A managed REST API service. API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. It is useful for building REST and WebSocket APIs. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, i.e. making requests to lambda's as well as web applications. Sockets are also supported. An API is built with a few clicks.

### Web application firewall (WAF)

WAF filters web traffic according to custom rules based on conditions that include IP addresses, HTTP headers and body, or custom URIs. More conveniently block exploits like SQL injection and XSS.
