# Developer productivity

> We have developed a measure of software engineering effectiveness we call the Developer Experience Index (DXI) which pinpoints the most critical factors in achieving higher software development efficiency and quality. The DXI is a predictive measure developed by our researchers, with over four million benchmark samples from hundreds of organizations across the world.

Multiple dimensions are needed to capture software development comprehensively because changes to one dimension, such as speed, may negatively affect others (e.g., quality or effectiveness). Some measures of the Dx core 4 are readily-available system-based metrics while others are self-reported data but easily obtainablee data.

1. Speed: PRs per engineer (team median), lead time deployment frequency, perceived rate of delivery
2. Effectiveness: Developer experience index of 
actionable issues (see below), time to 10th PR, regrettable attrition
    1. build and test
    2. change confidence
    3. clear direction
    4. code maintainability
    5. customer focus
    6. decision making
    7. deep work
    8. dev environment
    9. documentation
    10. ease of release
    11. incident handling
    12. incremental delivery
    13. local iteration speed
    14. planning process
    15. production debugging
    16. review turnaround
3. Quality
4. Impact
