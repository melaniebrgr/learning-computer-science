### AWS API Gateway

**A managed REST API service**. API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. It is useful for building REST and WebSocket APIs. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, i.e. making requests to lambda's as well as web applications. Sockets are also supported. An API can be built with a few clicks.

### AppSync

**A managed GraphQL API service**. You get an API without writing API code and worrying about the deployment. You defined schemas, queries, mutations, connect schemas to sources and resolvers. Both real-time and on-demand connections are supported similar to API Gateway.

### AWS Storage Gateway

Gives on-premises "limitless" cloud storage, like a Google Drive. There are three types: Tape, File and Volume Gateway.
