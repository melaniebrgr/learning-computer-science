## Introduction

Before LLMs appeared in 2022, we had different specific tools for summarization, translation. LLMs are a single but multi-purpose tool. Now we are asking what else they can do. Write a novel? Make a scientific discovery?

Cool things happening now:

- Reasoning, a.k.a "true abstract reasoning": The original "LLM boom" was more related to what’s called “emerging capabilities”. The reasoning trend started later. It was also related to solving math and programming tasks.
- Agents: LLMs orchestrate to decide which strategies to use. Google had a paper that demonstrated a research assistant multi-agentive tool.
- Open-endedness: It has the potential to adapt to solve many different tasks. You don't need to tune it to play a particular game. It can learn.
