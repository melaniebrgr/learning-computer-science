## Caching

"Storing the result of a computation _somewhere_ and returning the stored value instead of recomputing it again later." The caching strategy depends on the nature of the value being cached. There are a few additional concepts that come along with caching:

- **cache keys**: the cache key must contain all inputs that determine the result, e.g. using `useMemo` but not missing a dependency in the array. Getting the cache key itself can sometimes be costly.
- **cache invalidation**: strategies
  - proactive update of the cache, e.g. on PUT, POST, DELETE of a resource
  - timed invalication, e.g. HTTP cache control header directives like `max-age`
  - state while revalidate, works with time invalidation where the stale version is served while the fresh version is fetched in the background
  - force fresh values, e.g. in admin mode always force fetch latest values
  - soft-purge when data is updated but cache headers would persist the stale data for quite some longer period of time, mark the data as stale so on the next request it is fetched in the background

### Browser cache (HTTP cache)

The client (a browser) looks for the resources in the browser cache. If it's found (a hit), use it, else (a miss), go to the server. A "hit" means that the asset was in the cache. A "**miss**" means it can either be there or too old. This

- makes page requests faster,
- saves server computation, and
- saves money, e.g. mobile users.

A browser cache is a **private cache** because it is tied to a specific client, and contain response personalised to that user. Most web applications also use a CDN, a "globally distributed type of reverse proxy", to server resources closer to the user's location. A CDN is a public cache shared among users.

A browser can load resources from disk-cache or memory cache. **Disk Cache** stores resources (e.g., scripts, images) on the hard drive (or SSD) in the browserâ€™s cache directory. It is slower to access compared to memory but persistent across browser sessions (until cleared or expired).
Disk cache is used for resources that are cached but not immediately needed or when memory cache is full. Memory cache stores resources in RAM, making access extremely fast. **Memory cache** is temporary and cleared when the browser tab or session closes (or memory is needed elsewhere). It is prioritized for frequently accessed or recently used resources, like scripts loaded multiple times in a session.

The `Cache-Control` header defines directives that control caching behavior for both clients (like browsers) and intermediary caches (like CDNs, proxies). A `Cache-Control` header contains a list of policies (directives) to specify the browser caching. If conflicting directives are present, the most restrictive typically applies (e.g., `no-store` overrides `max-age`). Directives can be combined (e.g., `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600, must-revalidate`) to fine-tune behavior. It cannot be set on the client, e.g. with JS.

| **Directive** | **Purpose** | **Typical Use Case** |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| max-age | Specifies the maximum time in seconds a response is considered fresh. A response is "fresh" until its `max-age` or `s-maxage` expires (or based on heuristics if unspecified). Fresh responses can be served without contacting the server. | Use to cache an image for a fixed time, e.g., `max-age=86400` or 1 day. |
| s-maxage | Like `max-age`, but applies only to shared (proxy) caches, overriding `max-age`. | Used by CDNs to cache content longer than browsers (e.g., `s-maxage=31536000`). |
| no-store | Prohibits storing the response in any cache. | Sensitive data like banking transactions or private user data. |
| no-cache | Allows storing the response but requires revalidation with the server before use. Ensures users get the latest content without completely bypassing caching, useful for resources that may change frequently but can still benefit from conditional requests. | Cache dynamic content that needs freshness checks, e.g. news articles. |
| must-revalidate | Forces caches to revalidate stale responses with the server before serving. If the cache cannot reach the server or the response is invalid, it _must not_ serve the stale content and should return an error (e.g., 504 Gateway Timeout). | Ensure critical resources (e.g., legal documents) are fresh after expiration. |
| proxy-revalidate | Like `must-revalidate`, but applies only to shared (proxy) caches. | Enforce revalidation for CDNs while allowing browser flexibility. |
| public | Indicates the response can be cached by any cache (browser or proxy). | Publicly accessible resources like homepage assets. |
| private | Restricts caching to private (browser) caches, not shared (proxy) caches. | User-specific data like personalized dashboards. |
| no-transform | Prohibits caches from modifying the response (e.g., compressing images). | Ensure media files or sensitive payloads remain unchanged. |
| immutable | Indicates the response body will not change during its freshness period. | Cache immutable assets like versioned JavaScript files indefinitely. |
| stale-while-revalidate | Allows serving stale content while revalidating in the background. Revalidation involves checking with the server (e.g., via `If-Modified-Since` or `If-None-Match`) to confirm if the cached response is still valid. | Improve performance for slightly outdated content, e.g., `stale-while-revalidate=60`. |
| stale-if-error | Allows serving stale content if the server returns an error (e.g., 500). | Provide fallback content during server outages, e.g., `stale-if-error=86400` |

#### Example

```http
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600, no-transform
```

- `public`: Cacheable by all caches.
- `max-age=3600`: Fresh for 1 hour.
- `no-transform`: No modifications allowed.

#### Misc.

- Heuristic caching is when no caching header is set but the browser still caches based on a heuristic, liek 10% of the last modified date.
- `if-modified-since` is a date cache header that can be sent with the request, but since time zones make things difficult, so has been replaced with ETags instead, which is a hash based on the content. The cache bust the ETag the content needs be changed somehow, e.g. by renaming the name of a script href.

### Static-site generation (SSG)

SSG is just "build time" caching that uses a CDN and Cache-Control headers. It maybe have no performance benefits compared to a server-rendered site with a proper CDN and Cache-Control headers. SSG is limited as product evolves to have dynamic requirements.
