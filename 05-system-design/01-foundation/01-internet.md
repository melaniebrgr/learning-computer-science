# The Internet

> The Internet is “just” a network of interconnected computer networks. The term "Internet" literally means "between networks." It operates as a packet-switched mesh network  with best-effort delivery, meaning there are no guarantees on whether a packet will be delivered or how long it will take. The reason why the internet appears to operate so smoothly (at least from a technical perspective) is the layers of abstraction that handle retries, ordering, deduplication, security and so many other things behind the scenes. - Devon Peroutky (1)
