I have a simple server with Node HTTP server. I make request to "localhost:8080" from my machine, and the server that I'm running locally responds. The Node server exposes as arguments request and response objects. The request object representing the details of the inbound request. The response object the response that the server is sending to the client. `nodemon` automatically restarts the server when file changes in the directory are detected.
