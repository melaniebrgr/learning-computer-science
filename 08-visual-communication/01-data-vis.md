# InfoVis 1

## LECTURE 1

The course is about the design of numbers.

It's about creating tools to help you think about things, not just pretty or attractive tools, but useful ones. There are things that are impossible to communicate verbally. Images can amplify cognition. The image can be changed by users as they proceed to work with it. You start with raw data and you want to turn it to knowledge in the mind of the user.

The digital content of the world is expanding up to a zettabyte per year. While the rate of data is increasing, humans are stuck with unchanging brains; accordingly we create tools for thinking. For example, the pencil and paper is an artifact for extending memory, as are adding machines, and computers. Visualizations are another external cognitive tool.

Why target vision? It has a highly powerful cognitive capability. An example, [Anscombe's quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet) has the same mean, variance, correlation, and linear regression slopes, but if you graph them you get very different pictures. This understanding is not accessible by looking at the numbers. Information visualization leverages visual perception. 40% of our cortex is devoted to visual perception. Because vision is so deeply evolved we aren't aware of the rapid visual processing behind the scenes. Vision is high bandwidth, it can take in a billion bits per second, however we can't take in all that information, we can only take in or attend to a very tiny bit of it. Therefore **selection and design of information is essential**. We must manages the small attention of the person.

### Selective overview

Some of the earliest visualization are maps. Maps take non-numerical, spatial information and transform it into something useful. Others:

- [Napoleon's march on Moscow](https://ageofrevolution.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Minard.jpg), by Charles Minard, 1869.
- [Cholera outbreak related to water pump contamination](https://southernscientificireland.com/2024/05/24/cholera-outbreak/), by John Snow, 1854.
- Abstracted geometry of the London Underground: all tracks are horizontal, vertical, or 45 degree angle and all stations the same distance apart.
- Explanatory diagram, NIAID by Link studios.
- Data dense displays plotted over time, eg. fonts by Nicolas Felt, or Aaron Koblin's [flight patterns](https://www.aaronkoblin.com/work/flightpatterns/)
- Basic scientific visualization like changes in ozone density over the South Pole.
- Explanatory diagrams, eg. How to fix your computer, how to build a table
- Interactive displays, eg. Tree Cushing maps, network diagrams,
- [Map of the market](https://www.bewitched.com/marketmap.html) treemap.
- Node link diagrams like the visual thesaurus shows the relationship between words, how close they are in meaning.
- The shape of songs, analyzing songs to see the melodic structure is an example of an arc diagram, by Martin Wattenburg.
