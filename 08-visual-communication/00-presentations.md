# Presentations

Patrick Winston’s core message is that speaking is a learnable skill powered far more by knowledge and practice than by “talent,” and that good talks follow a few simple, reusable patterns.

## How to start

- Do not open with a joke; people are still settling in and it usually falls flat.
- Begin with an “empowerment promise”: clearly state what the audience will know or be able to do by the end that they cannot now.

## Structuring your talk

- Cycle on key ideas: revisit the main point multiple times so people who “fog out” can still catch it.
- “Build a fence” around your idea by contrasting it with others, so listeners know what it is and what it is not.
- Use verbal punctuation and numbered signposts (“first…, second…”) plus occasional questions to give re-entry points and keep attention.

## Time, place, and tools

- Choose a good time (he suggests around 11:00) and a well-lit, appropriately sized room that you have “cased” in advance.
- For teaching/informing, boards and physical props are best because they match audience processing speed and trigger “empathetic mirroring.”
- Slides are for exposing, not teaching: use very few words, large fonts, minimal clutter, no laser pointer, and let the slide support what you say rather than replace it.

## Informing and persuading

- To inform, combine a clear promise, visible passion for the subject, and stories that teach people how to think (questions to ask, ways to analyze and connect stories).
- For high‑stakes talks (oral exams, job talks), situate your work in context, practice with people who do not already know your research, and in the first five minutes show both your vision and what you have actually done.

## Being memorable and how to end

- To make work stick, package it with the “5 S’s”: a symbol, a slogan, a surprise, a salient standout idea, and a story of how it works or was done.
- Do not end with “Questions?” or a generic “Thank you”; end on a contributions slide that lists what you did, and close with a strong line (a joke, a benediction, or a salute to the audience) that signals you are finished.
