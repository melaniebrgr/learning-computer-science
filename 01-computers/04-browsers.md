## Navigation history

> Welcome to the dragon's maw. Navigation, session history, and the traversal through that session history are some of the most complex parts of this standard.

Pressing the browser back button moves the tab’s session history pointer to the previous entry; that may or may not cause a full page load, depending on whether the previous entry is a different document or just a different history state for the same document.
