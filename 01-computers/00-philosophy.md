> Kranzberg’s article lays out six “laws” about how technology and society shape each other, using historical case studies to argue that technology is deeply social, political, and human in character. Kranzberg concludes that understanding this sociotechnical history should inform how humanity chooses to “remake” its man-made world, answering not just what we can know but what we ought to do with our technological power.[1]

## Melvin Kranzberg's six laws

### First Law

**Technology is neither good nor bad, nor is it neutral.** This is because techonolgies effects depend on context, scale, and time horizon. For example, DDT was used to boost agricultural output and control pests. While in Western countries it was banned due to ecological damage, in India its health benefits in malaria control outweighed those risks. Therefore, technology should be analyzed within its sociocultural, economic, and environmental contexts, with attention to both short-term and long-term effects, and trade-offs between benefits and risks.

### Second Law

**Invention is the mother of necessity**. Every technological invention often creates new technical demands that must be addressed by further innovations, like cars needing roads, fuel, and regulations. Innovations should be viewed as systemically linked where one invention prompts a chain of necessary complementary developments

- Third Law: Technology comes in packages (systems), where devices, infrastructures, and organizations are interdependent, so changing one part forces changes elsewhere.
- Fourth Law: Even when technology is central to an issue, nontechnical factors—politics, economics, public perception, and values—tend to dominate actual policy decisions (e.g., nuclear power, SST, environmental regulation).
- Fifth Law: All history is relevant, but the history of technology is most relevant, because technological change underlies modern economics, education, culture, and even the arts, yet is often neglected in traditional history teaching.
- Sixth Law: Technology is a very human activity, inseparable from human purposes, values, and creativity; tools only matter through how people design, use, and interpret them.
