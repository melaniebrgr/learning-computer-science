# Computer Architecture

Architecture is traditional understood as 

> "the attributes of a system as seen by the programmer, i.e. the conceptual structure and functional behavior." - Gene Amdahl

The conceptual structure is distinct from the physical implementation, controls, and logic design.

How are hardware components designed? How are they chosen? How are the interfaces between hardware components designed? How are these choices influenced by functional, performance, energy, longevity, and cost goals? The is concern of computer architecture.
